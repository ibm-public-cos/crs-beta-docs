IBM Cloud Object Storage Standard Cross Regional Service provides an innovative solution to the problem of managing increasingly vast amounts of unstructured data. Information is encrypted and dispersed across three geographic regions (Dallas, San Jose, and Washington) and accessed by using an implementation of the S3 API.

This Standard Cross Regional Service beta provides higher reliability and availability than using a single regional data center at the cost of slightly higher latency.  If a given data center is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment.  When the data center comes back online, missed changes are applied, returning the system to normal function.

Customers can use either the SoftLayer web-based portal or a RESTful S3 API to interact with their storage. This documentation provides support to get started with provisioning accounts, to create buckets, to upload objects, and to use a reference of common API interactions.
