IBM Cloud Object Storage provides a high performance solution to the problem of managing increasingly vast amounts of unstructured data. Information is sliced, encrypted, and dispersed across three regional data centers and accessed using an S3 interface.

Standard Cross Regional Service provides higher reliability and availability than using a single regional data center at the cost of slightly higher latency.  If a given region is compromised the object store continues to function without impediment.  When the data center comes back online, the information is rebuilt and the system continues to function normally.

Customers can use either a web-based portal, or a RESTful S3 API to interact with their storage. This documentation provides support to get started with provisioning accounts, creating buckets and uploading objects, and a reference of common interactions supported by the API.

The Standard Cross Regional Service is currently in beta, and only available to registered users.  Please contact IBM sales to enroll if not registered.
