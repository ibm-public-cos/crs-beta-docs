IBM Cloud Object Storage provides a high performance solution to the problem of managing increasingly vast amounts of unstructured data. Information is sliced, encrypted, and dispersed across three regional data centers (Dallas, San Jose, and Washington) and accessed by using an S3 interface.

This Standard Cross Regional Service beta provides higher reliability and availability than using a single regional data center at the cost of slightly higher latency.  If a given data center is compromised, the object store continues to function without impediment.  When the data center comes back online, the information is rebuilt, and the system continues to function normally.

Customers can use either a web-based portal or a RESTful S3 API to interact with their storage. This documentation provides support to get started with provisioning accounts, to create buckets, to upload objects, and to use a reference of common API interactions.

IBM COS Standard Cross Region is currently in beta, and only available to registered users.  Please contact [IBM sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure/object-storage/) to enroll if not registered.
