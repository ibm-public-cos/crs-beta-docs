# Documentation for IBM Cloud Object Storage 

This repository hosts the staging documentation for Cloud Object Storage in the public cloud (Bluemix Infrastructure/SoftLayer).  It has not been integrated into the Bluemix docs microservice because of a need for flexibility as the offering becomes more settled and fully featured - it will be merged into the main docs when it is fully brokered into Bluemix and available as a native service.

There are two branches: `gh-pages` (used for production and  pushed to a public repository) and `master` (used for staging and merged into the production branch).  Any issues, edits, or pull requests should be made against `master`. The staging environment has a 'edit me' button on each page that links to the source file.

The staging documentaion can be viewed here: https://pages.github.ibm.com/cs-docs/crs-docs/

Production documentation can be viewed here: https://ibm-public-cos.github.io/crs-docs/
