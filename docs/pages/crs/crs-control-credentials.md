{% include note.html content="The user interface portal provides a high level view of a storage account.  It is possible to view credentials and endpoints using the portal as well as by using the Softlayer API." %}

#### Using the control portal to view credentials and endpoints
1. Credentials and available endpoints can be viewed, by clicking the  **View Credentials** link on the top right of the details page.
2. Click the credentials header to expand and show the credentials.
3. An account can have a maximum of two credentials at once. This allows for credentials to be rotated in applications without interruption. A new credential can be created, by clicking the **Add credential** button just below the Credentials header.
4. A credential can also be deleted, by clicking the **-** button to the right of the credential. A confirmation dialog will pop-up for confirmation before the credential is deleted.
5. The page also shows the various authentication endpoints that can be used to access the account.
