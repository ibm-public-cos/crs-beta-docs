 IBM Cloud does not currently provide native SDKs for interacting with COS offerings.  In the case of IBM COS Cross-Region, stored data is accessed using an implementation of the S3 API. Compatability with an established object strorage API allows developers to make use of a large ecosystem of third-party tools and SDKs.  

 A full list of supported S3 API operations can be found in the [API Overview]( {{ site.baseurl }}/crs-operations.html).

 This documentation provides basic introductions to using popular S3 API [client applications]( {{ site.baseurl }}/crs-guis.html) and a [command line interface]( {{ site.baseurl }}/crs-cli.html), as well as an SDK for the [Python]( {{ site.baseurl }}/crs-python.html) programming language.
