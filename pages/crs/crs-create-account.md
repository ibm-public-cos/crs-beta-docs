## Understanding IBM Cloud platform
 
Until recently, IBM offered Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service as two distinct products: [Bluemix](https://bluemix.net) and [SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com).  Bluemix provides a robust application development platform with direct access to cutting edge IBM technologies and DevOps services. SoftLayer provides access to infrastructure services, such as bare metal or virtual servers, data storage, and networking.

Now, these lines are dissolving as we integrate infrastructure offerings into the Bluemix catalog of services.
