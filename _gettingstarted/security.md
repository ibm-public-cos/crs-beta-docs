> IBM COS Standard Cross Region is currently in open trial.  Please visit [IBM Cloud](https://www.softlayer.com/Store/orderService/objectStorage) to participate.

IBM Cloud Object Storage encrypts data both in transit from clients via HTTPS endpoints as well in transit between geographic regions.   Additionally, all data at rest is encrypted with keys automatically managed by IBM Cloud Object Storage.

An object deleted by a customer is immediately made unreadable.
