The following table describes which bucket operations are supported in COS Dedicated IBM Managed API. It also indicates some operations that, while not supported, can be accomplished using another mechanism such as the Manager Web Interface or are planned for inclusion in future API versions. Any S3 API operation that is not present is not supported.

**Bucket operations:**

| DELETE Bucket CORS | Yes | Requestor must be granted ``FULL_CONTROL`` permission for bucket. |
| DELETE Bucket lifecycle | No | |
