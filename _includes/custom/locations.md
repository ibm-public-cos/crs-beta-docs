{% include note.html content="Using third-party tools or SDKs may enforce setting a 'LocationConstraint' when creating a bucket. If required, this value must be set to 'us-standard'. Unlike AWS S3, IBM COS uses this value to indicate the storage class of an object. This field has no relation to physical geography or region - those values are provided within the endpoint used to connect to the service. Currently, the only permitted values for 'LocationCostraint' are 'us-standard', 'us-vault', 'us-cold', 'us-flex', 'us-south-standard', 'us-south-vault', us-south-cold', and 'us-south-flex'." %}
